TLB miss flow
Translate virtual address â†’ TLB search â†’ not found â†’ to IPT â†’ found page â†’ update TLB â†’ return translated address

TLB miss + Page fault
Translate virtual address â†’ TLB search â†’ not found â†’ exception â†’ IPT â†’ page fault â†’ exception â†’ pageInPageOut â†’ update TLB â†’ return translated address

Whenever there is an issue with translation, it starts with a TLB miss as TLB is the first level of check.
