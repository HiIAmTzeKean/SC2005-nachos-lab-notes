# TLB
TLB functions both like a page table, but a smaller one. Caches subset of page table for faster address translation.

```C++
class TranslationEntry {
  public:
    int virtualPage;  	// The page number in virtual memory.
    int physicalPage;  	// The page number in real memory (relative to the
			//  start of "mainMemory"
    bool valid;         // If this bit is set, the translation is ignored.
			// (In other words, the entry hasn't been initialized.)
    bool readOnly;	// If this bit is set, the user program is not allowed
			// to modify the contents of the page.
    bool use;           // This bit is set by the hardware every time the
			// page is referenced or modified.
    bool dirty;         // This bit is set by the hardware every time the
			// page is modified.
};
```
